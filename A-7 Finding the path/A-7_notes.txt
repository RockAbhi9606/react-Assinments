useEffect:-----

if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render.
if dependency Array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on initial render only(just once)
if no dependency Array is[btnName] => useEffect is called on btnName is updated.

useState:---------------

hooks always use inside a function or a hook function on higher level(on top)
never use useState inside if else condition.I create inconsistentcy in our program.
never use useState inside for loop.
